## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I am Manoranjan :)

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working as a Photonic IC Design Engineer at Quanfluence, India. Prior to that, I was a Post-doctorate fellow at IIT Bombay. I have a MS+PhD dual degree in the field of photonics from IIT Guwhahati, where my research work revolved around designing hybrid (de)multiplexers for optical interconnects. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from NIT Rourkela.
- ðŸŒ± Excited about the era of photonics. Trying to learn new things everyday and finding out ways to contribute.
